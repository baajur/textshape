Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch



textshape 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

* `bind_list` added to `rbind` a `list` of named `data.frame`s or `vector`s

* `split_transcript` added to split a transcript style vector (e.g.,
  `c("greg: Who me", "sarah: yes you!")` into a name and dialogue vector that is
  coerced to a `data.table`.

* `change_index` added  for extracting the indices of changes in runs within an
  atomic vector.  Pairs well with `split_index`.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

CHANGES

* `split_index` now uses `change_index(x)` as the default when `x` is an atomic
  vector.


textshape 0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
